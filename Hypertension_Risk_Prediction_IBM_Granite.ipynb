            "\n",
            "1. **Age**: The patient is 60 years old. Age is a risk factor for hypertension.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Salt Intake**: With a salt intake of 8.6 grams, this is above the WHO recommended maximum of 5 grams per day, which can contribute to hypertension.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Stress Score**: A score of 4 indicates moderate stress levels. Chronic stress can elevate blood pressure.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **BP History**: The patient has a history of hypertension, suggesting a predisposition to the condition.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Sleep Duration**: Sleeping for 6.5 hours, although within the recommended 7-9 hours, does not indicate poor sleep quality which can be linked to hypertension.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **BMI**: A BMI of 22.7 is within the healthy range (18.5-24.9), suggesting the patient is not overweight, which can be a risk factor for hypertension.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Medication**: Currently taking a diuretic, a common medication for managing hypertension, indicating the patient's current condition is being actively treated.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Family History**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the patient's risk of developing the condition.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Exercise Level**: Low exercise level is a risk factor for hypertension as physical inactivity can contribute to high blood pressure.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Smoking Status**: As a non-smoker, this is a positive factor as smoking is known to raise blood pressure in both the short and long term.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite having some protective factors (BMI, non-smoking status), the presence of a pre-existing hypertension diagnosis, high salt intake, age, stress, family history, low exercise, and current medication use strongly suggest the patient still has hypertension. Therefore, the prediction is **Yes**.\n"
